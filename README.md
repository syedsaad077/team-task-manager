# 🚀 Team Task Manager

A full-stack collaborative task management platform built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Designed for teams with strict role-based access control, real-time-like notifications, and a clean dark-mode UI.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- JWT-based login and signup
- Role-Based Access Control: **Admin** and **Member** roles
- Strict data isolation — members only see projects and tasks they are assigned to

### 📁 Project Management
- Admins can create, edit, and delete projects
- Multi-select member assignment during project creation/editing
- Cascading deletion — removing a project also removes all its tasks

### ✅ Task Management
- Admins can create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to specific members with a due date
- Filter tasks by **Status** and **Project**

### 🔄 Advanced Approval Workflow
| Role | Available Actions |
|------|------------------|
| **Member** | Start Working → Submit for Review |
| **Admin** | ✓ Approve (Completed) or ✗ Request Rework |

**Status lifecycle:** `Pending` → `In Progress` → `In Review` → `Completed` / `Rework`

### 🔔 Real-Time Notifications (In-App Bell)
- **Members** receive notifications when:
  - They are added to a new project
  - A new task is assigned to them
  - Admin changes their task status (Rework / Completed)
- **Admins** receive notifications when:
  - A member submits a task for review
- Notifications can be marked as read individually
- Red pulsing dot badge for unread count

### 💬 Task Comments
- All users can post threaded comments on any task
- Comments display the author's name and timestamp

### 📧 Email Notifications
- Automatic email sent when a task is assigned
- Supports **test mode** (Ethereal Email) and **production mode** (Gmail SMTP)

### 🌙 Dark Mode
- Persistent dark mode toggle via `localStorage`
- Full dark theme across all pages and components
